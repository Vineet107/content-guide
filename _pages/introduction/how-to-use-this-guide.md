The NASA Content Guide is was developed for those who write web content, especially for NASA external websites 

## Introduction

This guide helps writers create content that’s easy to understand and can be used as a reference on an as-needed basis.

Sometimes government websites talk _at_ readers rather than _to_ or _with_ them, which may convey an unfriendly tone. Sometimes a government website is written in "governmentese," leaving a reader frustrated or not knowing where they can find more information. 

This guide takes that frustration into account, as well as several commonly supported guidelines about writing for the web.

Using this guide can help content designers benefit from our experience to date, incorporate user feedback into the editorial process, and build trust by communicating in a consistent manner. Many resources were used to prepare this guide and special thanks are given to 18F, 
a digital service agency that supports Federal agencies in improving the way they deliver digital services and technology products.



## If you work at NASA

This guide for reference on an as-needed basis. It’s here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word _federal_, for instance, or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.

To this end, we’ve structured the guide into descriptively named sections. Find the topic you’re looking for in our table of contents, or search by keyword. We aren’t opposed if you’d like to read this guide start to finish, of course.
