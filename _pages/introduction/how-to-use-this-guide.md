## Why this guide was developed 

The NASA Content Guide was developed to to help NASA web content writers create information that’s easy to understand and can be used on an as-needed basis.  

Sometimes government websites talk _at_ readers rather than _to_ or _with_ them, which may convey an unfriendly or distant tone. Sometimes a government website is written in "governmentese," leaving a reader frustrated or not knowing where they can find more information. 
This guide takes that frustration into account.  

Using this guide can help content designers write in a consistent manner so that although many different topics are discussed and written by different authors, NASA's external websites will appear seamless to our readers.

Many resources were used to prepare this guide and special thanks are given to 18F fro their contribution in preparing this guide. 18F is a digital service agency that supports Federal agencies in improving the way they deliver digital services and technology products.
