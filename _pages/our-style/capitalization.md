title: Capitalization
---

Follow a consistent capitalization scheme.

Creating trustworthy internal and external communications relies, to a large extent, on the content’s consistency. Inconsistent spellings and capitalizations undermine your narrative authority. We follow these capitalization guidelines:

- Do capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and agencies
- Don't capitalize _agile,_ unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Don't capitalize _open source,_ unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Don't capitalize _federal_ or _government_
- Don't capitalize _agency_ or _center_ unless used as part of the full name of an agency or center or another proper noun 

When you're deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, keep in mind that in English, title case is often a marker of formality. Using it judiciously can help clarify that you're speaking about a specific, official thing (such as a form, office, or person). Implying formality where it doesn’t belong or exist, can cause cognitive stress to the reader. For instance:

- It makes sense to capitalize the phrase "Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return" because you want users to know the exact, official title of that specific form.
- It could confuse readers to capitalize _income taxes_ or _income tax forms_, because those phrases could refer to any number of possible forms.

See additional capitalization rules in the [Specific words and phrases](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/specific-words-and-phrases/)
section.

## Personal titles

Capitalize a personal title when it precedes a name. For example, *Director Lopez got the approval*. 

Do not capitalize a personal title that succeeds a name. For example, do not write *Lopez, the Director, got the approval*.

Do not capitalize a personal title when the word "the" appears in front of it. For example, *the director got the approval* or *the director, Lopez, got the approval*.

Whenever possible, keep titles gender neutral. For example, use *firefighter* instead of *fireman* and use *chairperson* instead of *chairman*.

## Headings

Headlines, page titles, subheads and similar content should follow sentence case, and should not include a trailing colon. For example:

> _Making sense of Washington’s tech landscape_  

> _Privileges and responsibilities_

## NASA's frequently used words 

For a listing of NASA's frequently used words that should or should not be capitalized, please refer to the excerpt taken from the NASA Procedural Requirements NPR 1450.10, Appendix H. [Capitalization](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_1450_010D_&page_name=AppendixH).

**Please note**:
The NPR refers to NASA’s “Government” style, which we do not follow 100% for communication products or platforms, such as for a Glenn website.  If you come across a difference, always go with the *[NASA Stylebook](http://communications.nasa.gov/sites/communications.nasa.gov/files/files/NASA%20Stylebook%20Rev%207%20-%20March%202017.docx) or the AP Stylebook recommendation. One example is the word “center.” 

For example, using the NPR style for a written memo, one would write:
>_Our goal for the Center is to reach $400,000 for the Combined Federal Campaign._

But, the same sentence on a Glenn website would be written:
>_Our goal for the center is to reach $400,000 for the Combined Federal Campaign._
